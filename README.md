# INTRO
hello there this is my notes for as long as i dont lose interest it will be for most subjects that let me use a computer and will have as much infomatoin as possible in one place
# Install 
so you want to use the .md files more like pdfs than large blocks of hashtags and brakets your going to need to set up obsidian and learn how to update it so you get the latest notes.
1. go to https://obsidian.md/download and go though the set up prossess but dont create a volt when prompted
2. next go https://gitforwindows.org/ and install git
3. create a new folder on divice (Dont use onedrive)
4. right click the folder in file explorer and click open in terminal
5. then write the command "git clone https://github.com/NamelessBystander/School_Notes_PLC.git"
6. now go back into obsidian and click chose folder as volt and chose the folder you created

# Update
Now you have it installed every time you want to update the notes you need to go to file explorer find the file that is your volt right click open in terminal and write the commands (git reset --hard origin) then (git pull)


and your done good job
