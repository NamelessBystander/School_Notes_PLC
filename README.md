# Introduction

Hello there, This is my collection of notes for various subjects. As long as I stay interested, I'll keep adding information here, covering any topic that allows me to use a computer. The goal is to have as much information as possible in one place.

## Installation

To use these .md files in a more readable format (like PDFs rather than large blocks of hashtags and brackets), you'll need to set up Obsidian and learn how to update it to get the latest notes.

1. **Download Obsidian**  
   Go to [Obsidian's website](https://obsidian.md/download) and follow the setup process, but don't create a vault when prompted.

2. **Install Git**  
   Go to [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and install Git.

3. **Create a Folder**  
   Create a new folder on your device (don't use OneDrive).

4. **Open Folder in Terminal**  
   Right-click the folder in File Explorer and select "Open in Terminal."

5. **Clone the Repository**  
   Run the following command in the terminal:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NamelessBystander/School_Notes_PLC.git
   
6. **Open Folder as Vault in Obsidian**
   
   Open Obsidian, click "Open folder as vault," and select the folder you created.

## Updating Notes

To update the notes, follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal in Vault Folder**
   
   Go to File Explorer, find your vault folder, right-click, and select "Open in Terminal."
3. **Reset and Pull Latest Changes**
   
   Run the following commands in the terminal:
   ```sh
   git reset --hard origin
   git pull
   ```
