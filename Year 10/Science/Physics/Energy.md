## Conservation of energy
Energy is never created or destroyed it is only converted to other forms. This is called the conservation of energy, the most basic form of this is when a ball is dropped. When the ball is held in the air it has gravitational potential energy, when it is dropped the energy is slowly converted to kinetic until it is at ground level when all the potential energy is now kinetic.

*e.g* A $50kg$ rock is held at rest at an altitude of $80m$ then dropped
- When it is at rest the $E_{GP} = 39200 J$  and the $E_K=0J$ meaning the $TE=39200J$
- When it is $20m$ off the ground the $E_{GP} = 9800 J$  and the $E_K=29400J$ meaning the $TE=39200J$ again
- When it is at ground level the $E_{GP} = 0 J$  and the $E_K=39200J$ meaning Still the $TE=39200J$
