| Quantity     | Symbol | Units                     | Symbol  | Example        |
| ----------- | ------: | ------------------------- | -------: | -------------- |
| time         | $t$    | seconds                   | $s$     | $t = 4.2s$     |
| distance     | $s$    | metres                    | $m$     | $s = 24m$      |
| velocity     | $u,v$  | metres per second         | $ms^-1$ | $u = 12ms^{-1}$  |
| acceleration | $g,a$  | metres per second squared | $ms^-2$ | $g = 9.8ms^{-2}$ |
$u$ - is the initial velocity or starting speed of the object
$v$ - is the final velocity
$t$ - is the time taken by the object to travel
$s$ - is the distance travelled by the object
$a$ - is the acceleration of the object
$g$ - is the acceleration due to gravity which equals $9.8ms^-2$ or $-9.8ms^-2$ if the object is thrown upwards

## Motions Graphs
Motion graphs show different perspectives on an event that occurs. the 3 most used ones being, Distance over time, Velocity over time and acceleration over time.



*e.g.* a car accelerates from rest at $2m^{-2}$ for $10s$, it then travels at a new speed for a further $10s$. Finally it decelerates to a stop in $4s$.

[^1]:The distance travelled by any object can be found by finding the area under the velocity graph.*
[^2]:The gradient of the slope at any time is the acceleration at that point*

## Conservation of Energy
In any collision, momentum is conserved  this means that momentum before the collisions must equal the momentum after it. The most common example of this is with two balls of different masses colliding. 

**Solving**
*e.g.* A $3kg$ ball travelling east at $4ms^-2$ collides with a stationary $2kg$ ball. After the collision the $3kg$ ball travels east at $3ms^-2$. Calculate the speed of the $2kg$ ball after the collision

- First Calculate the total momentum of the objects before the collision by multiplying the velocity of each object by its mass and adding them all together. 
$$p=(3*4)+(2*0)$$ $$p=12$$ 
- Second rewrite the equation with the new speeds (keep $p$ the same)
$$12=(3*2)+(2v)$$
- Lastly rearrange so $v$ is the subject and solve
$$\frac{12-(3*2)}{2}=v$$
$$2ms^{-2} = v$$
