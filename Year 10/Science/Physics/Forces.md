## Newton's laws
**First Law**
Objects in [[Motion]] stay in [[Motion]] unless and external force is acted upon it and objects at rest say at rest unless a force is acted upon it

**Second Law**
When unbalanced force $F$ acts on an object of mass $m$, it accelerates the object given by the formulas $F=ma$ or $a=\frac{F}{m}$
**Third Law**
Each action has an equal and opposite reaction. this mean that when you walk the ground is pushing you as much as you are pushing it.
