Is the study of heredity and variation of organisms though combining chromosomes of parents. This is only possible in sexual reproduction. Each chromosome comes in a pair called Homologous Chromosomes

### Traits
To decide what the offspring of two organisms will look like different genes will fight over what will be visible. The child or generation 1 ($F^1$) will get a combination of the two parent ($P$) genes and each Allele get compared. This can be written as a Monohybrid cross. This is a way to see the results of crossing two genes where parents differ by only a single trait. Each allele is represented with two letters, with dominant genes being capital letters and recessive being lowercase.
*e.g*  a plant homologous dominant gene of being tall being crossed with a homologous recessive gene of being short. This would look like $TT * tt$.

### Punnet square
The punnet square is a very useful tool for predicting the traits of the children of two parents. It easily scales with the amount of different genes but in its simplest form it can display a monohybrid cross in with four squares. On the top and left side each parents genes are split and assigned a row/column, in each of the squares a new allele is created with the letters of the square's respective row and column with the dominant gene coming first if present.

Here it can be seen that all of $F^1$ will be Heterogeneous and be tall in this case as it is the dominate gene. This is then written in genotype and phenotype notation.

Genotypes:
- 100% $Tt$

Phenotypes
- 100% Tall plants

The $F^2$ square can be created by using the results of the $F^1$ square as the ($P$).
When there are different results for the children unlike the example above one of the inside squares will be chosen randomly.

### Mutation
Gene mutations are a permanent change to a gene. They can range in severity from just one gene to large parts of chromosomes. They can occur by either external sources or be inherited from a parent.

**Acquired mutations**
Acquired mutations although are still permanent are much harder to pass on to the next generations as they need to effect the sperm or egg [[Cells]] before the organism mates. There are many ways to get a mutation, but the most common ones areâ€¦
- Radiation
- Chemicals
- Mistakes during cell division 

*E.g.* Cancer

**Inherited mutations**
Inherited mutation are given to an organism by its parents and is present in every cell. It can only happen if there is a mutation in the sperm or egg [[Cells]], if the mutation is present on the x-chromosome it is called an x linkage (From the mother) and vice versa for the y (From the father).
*E.g.* down syndrome.
