Organelles are parts of eukaryotic [[Cells]], each of them have a task to complete within the cell to make it function.

### Nucleus
The nucleus overlooks and controls everything the cell does, as well as decides when to grow or reproduce. It does this though a process called protein synthesis[^1]. This is not done randomly however, the nucleus uses a instruction manual called DNA which it maintains by organising and replacing chromosomes[^2].

[^2]: Chromosomes are long string-like structures of DNA that appear in the nucleus when a cell is ready to divide.

**Parts of the nucleus**
- The nuclear membrane covers the nucleus, allowing selective materials to flow in and out of small pores.
- The nucleolus is a small dense region inside the nucleus, this is where the main functions are done.

### Cell membrane
The cell membrane is a key part of any cell as it decides what will enter and exit the cell at any time. It also has proteins on the outside that help other [[Cells]] identify it.

**Parts of the cell membrane**
- Lipid bi-layer - Is two layers of lipid[^3] which are hydrophilic[^4]and in-between them is a hydrophobic[^5] layer of of tales.

- Proteins - act as a selective path way in and out of the cell, with different proteins letting different things in. this can also be one way where a type of material can pass in but needs energy to leave again.

- glycoproteins - proteins attached to carbohydrates make act as name-tags that other [[Cells]] can read
- Cholesterol - reduce the fluidity and act as antifreeze for the cell, this keeps it from dying in cold climates.


[^1]: This is the process by which amino acids are arranged to make proteins. 
[^3]: A mix of fats and waxes
[^4]: easily absorbing or dissolving in water.
[^5]: water repellent in this case due to oil
