#### Types of cells
** Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic**
Cells are the building blocks of all life on earth. each are made up of a small but complex set of intracellular structures that in most cases let it do a very simple task very well. In essence their are two types of cells Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells which are similar in structure but have some very distinctive differences.

|Prokaryotic|Eukaryotic|
|---------------|------------|
|found in bacteria|found in fungi, plants and animals|
|Smaller[^1]|Larger|
|Simple|More complex|
|No True nucleus|True nucleus|
|Circular DNA|Linear DNA|
|Simple structures|[[Organelles]]|
[^1]:Because Prokaryotic cells are self sufficient they need nutrients quickly having a smaller body makes it much easier for nutrients to get though.

**Virus**
A virus is a small organism that infects living things. It makes copy's of itself inside of the organisms cells

 #### Cell reproduction
 Cells ether reproduce Sexually or Asexually. Asexual reproduction is consists of replicating the parent cell exactly and only needs one parent[^2]. Sexual reproduction requires the sperm from a male and the egg of a female resulting in a mix of genes in the child.
 
** Asexual **
For a cell to reproduce Asexually the cell has to go though a process called mitosis. This consists of 5 stages. But first the cell's DNA prepares for the splitting in a process called interphase this takes 19 times more time then the actual splinting.
1.  Prophase - In this phase the nucleus envelops disappears and the chromosomes become visible
2. Metaphase - The chromosomes move to the equator of the nucleus
3. Anaphase - The sister chromosomes move to the poles of the nucleus
4. Telophase - two sister nucleus become visible and start to move apart
5. Cytokinesis - The rest of the cell splits and the reproductions is complete
