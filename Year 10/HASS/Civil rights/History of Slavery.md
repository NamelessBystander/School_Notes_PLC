#### Why use slaves?
**Pros**
Slaves were mainly used to pick cotton, mostly in the south of America. This was one of the largest industries of America, as 3/4 of all cotton was made in America. This made the production of cotton very profitable, as it was free labour with large amounts of product that could be sold for lots of money. This was one of the main drivers of progression in America and was one of the reasons that America went through a large industrial revolution.

**Cons**
The focus on selling, buying and working slaves slowed down all other aspects of technology.

#### Slave Drama
Even poor white people who did not own slaves supported slavery as they could see the economic benefits of free labour and seen as a necessary evil. The south also began to justify it saying things like the bible supported it, they were inferior people and needed to be slaves and that it was good for them as they were feed and given a place to sleep.

#### Slave brutality
slaves were raped and wiped at the will of the master as there were no laws against the rights of the slaves, this let sadists torture and mutilate others at any time. A way of making this seem less cruel, to the masters. Tried to dehumanise the slaves so that they were more like objects. They did this by purposely breaking up families and prohibiting them to learn to read and write.


#### Facts
- 4 million slaves in the US that made up a third of the population 
-  Resistance was punished harshly so normally instead of killing they slowed work
